				<h2>Jegichagi (제기차기)</h2>
				<div class="text-background">
					<p>Jegichagi is a Korean traditional outdoor game in which players kick a paper jegi into the air and attempt to keep it aloft. A jegi is similar to a shuttlecock, and is made from paper wrapped around a small coin. The goal of the game is to kick the jegi into the air and prevent it from falling, with players aiming to keep it aloft as long as possible. It is a popular game during festivals and outdoor gatherings, offering both fun and a way to develop agility and coordination.</p>
					<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
					<p>I like jegichagi, even though I'm not very good at it. It is fun because it combines physical skill with friendly competition. Even when I clumsily miss, I still have fun because of the lighthearted atmosphere and the shared laughter of others.</p>

				<h2>Ddakji (딱지)</h2>
				<div class="text-background">
					<p>Ddakji is a traditional Korean game that involves flipping paper tiles. Players fold colorful paper into square shapes and then attempt to throw their tiles in a way that flips their opponent’s tile over. The player who successfully flips the most tiles wins the game. It’s a popular game often played by children during festivals or casual gatherings. Ddakji requires both skill and precision, as the goal is to land your tile perfectly on top of the other, while also being quick and strategic to outplay your opponent.</p>
					<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
					<p>I find Ddakji to be exhilarating. When you manage to flip someone else's ddakji, it is so satisfying, even when I miss it it's always filled with good fun.</p>
