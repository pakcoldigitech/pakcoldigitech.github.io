						<h2 class="card-title">2. Performance and Engine Specs</h2>
						<p class="card-text">The VN SS Commodore was powered by a 5.0-liter V8 engine, which produced around 165 kW (221 hp) of power and 400 Nm of torque. This engine allowed the SS variant to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just under 7 seconds, which was impressive for its time. The V8 engine was paired with a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic, offering drivers a choice in how they wanted to experience the car. With a rear-wheel-drive layout and a well-tuned suspension system, the VN SS offered a balanced and enjoyable driving experience that made it a standout in the performance sedan market of the early 90s.</p>
